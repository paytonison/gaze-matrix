> **“The Gaze Matrix: Cinematic Censorship Heuristics as a Framework for AI Content Moderation”**

The paper proposes the **Gaze Matrix**, a conceptual and practical framework that borrows from a century of cinematic censorship and rating systems (e.g., the Hays Code, MPA ratings) to design more interpretable, accountable AI content moderation systems.

## Overview

Modern AI content moderation struggles with:

- Opaque decision-making  
- Context-insensitive classification (e.g., depiction vs. endorsement)  
- Over- and under-enforcement on marginalized communities  
- Difficulty translating high-level policy into model behavior  

Cinema has wrestled with related issues for decades: how to show violence, sexuality, crime, and taboo topics; how to distinguish “showing” from “approving”; how to gate audiences instead of banning content.

This paper:

1. **Bridges film history and AI moderation**  
   Connects cinematic censorship/rating regimes and film-theory notions of the gaze to contemporary platform governance.

2. **Introduces the Gaze Matrix**  
   A grid mapping four types of gaze—authorial, institutional, algorithmic, audience—against five dimensions of content:
   - Representation mode (depiction vs. endorsement)  
   - Harm type  
   - Audience vulnerability  
   - Circulation/scale  
   - Affective framing

3. **Derives seven “cinematic heuristics” for AI**  
   Including:
   - H1: Depiction without celebration  
   - H2: Consequences for transgression  
   - H3: Contextualization requirement  
   - H4: Audience gating rather than pure bans  
   - H5: Proportional explicitness  
   - H6: Mixed-gaze accountability  
   - H7: Visible rule sets and descriptors  

4. **Operationalizes the framework**  
   - Policy design (from prose to matrix)  
   - Data labeling and training objectives  
   - Runtime moderation flows (multi-stage, hybrid human/AI)  

5. **Critically reflects on censorship’s harms**  
   Uses the history of cinematic censorship (heteronormativity, racism, paternalism, opacity) as a set of warnings and guardrails rather than a moral blueprint.
